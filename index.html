			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<p>Hi, if you want to read something boring, please continue.</p>
			<p>My name is Johan. I have a wife and two kids. That is a lot. 
			<p>In the morning we get up and dress the kids, provide them with some basic food and bring them to school. 
				 In the evening we pick them up from school, provide them with more basic food (warm  this time) and put them to bed. 
				 Then we go to bed because we are tired. It is boring, I know...</p> 
			<p>We don't have a pet. My wife and I think they are too furry. Maybe because we have no pet, I should not talk about it. I don't know.</p>
			<p>When I was younger, I wasn't this boring. It just happened. Very slowly, gradually. I blame the children.</p>
			<p>Actually my wife is not my wife. But she is not really my girlfriend either. We are wettelijk samenwonend... 
			It's the people from the city, they wrote it down somewhere. It's weird, I know.</p>
			
			<p>Don't read my cv or the article I wrote. It's dead serious and not interesting at all.</p>
			<p>Please don't take most of the above seriously.</p>
